- 👋 Hi, I’m Coral Sheldon-Hess, @csheldonhess
- 👀 I’m interested in inclusion, diversity, equity, and accessibility (IDEA) and in making usable and beautiful things with technology.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to build an automated data pipeline within the limitations afforded by a bureaucratic corporate IT structure. 😅 (Too specific? I'm building up my data engineering skills.)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on something that makes the world a better place.
- 📫 How to reach me: my first name at my surname (with the hyphen or without, should work either way) dot org; links to social media at [my website](https://sheldon-hess.org/coral) are kept pretty much up to date.
